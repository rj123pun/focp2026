Task1 summary
Pizza 4-for-3 Pricing Program
This program calculates the total cost of a pizza order using Beckett Pizza Plaza’s 4-for-3 offer. The customer must order exactly four pizzas, each of which may have a different price. Under this offer, the cheapest pizza is free, and the customer only pays for the remaining three.
The program prompts the user to enter the price of each pizza and validates the input to ensure all prices are valid, positive numbers. If an invalid value is entered, the user is asked to re-enter the price.
Once all four valid prices are provided, the program determines the cheapest pizza, removes it from the total, and calculates the final order price. It also computes and displays the percentage discount the customer received, which can be up to a maximum of 25%.
This program demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input, input validation, list handling, basic arithmetic, and conditional logic. It provides a practical example of how real-world pricing rules can be implemented in a simple Python application.





Task2 Summary
Password Security Check Program
This program simulates a simple password verification system. It first asks the user to enter a password and checks whether it meets a minimum length requirement. If the password is fewer than 9 characters long, the program informs the user and exits immediately.
If the password is long enough, the program performs an additional security check by randomly selecting three positions within the password. The user is asked to correctly enter the characters found at those positions. If the user makes a mistake at any point, the program stops and reports that the security check has failed. If all three characters are entered correctly, the program confirms that the security check has passed.
The program demonstrates basic concepts such as input validation, string indexing, random number generation, conditional logic, and loop control. It is designed as a simple example of how multi-step authentication checks can be implemented in Python.
