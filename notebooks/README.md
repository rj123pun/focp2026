Programming Portfolio – Week 2
This collection contains beginner Python programs focusing on user input, arithmetic operations, and output formatting. The tasks include:
*Greeting Program – Asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.
*Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter – Converts a temperature entered in Celsius to Fahrenheit.
*Lab Group Calculator – Calculates the number of student groups and leftover students based on group size.
*Sweet Distribution Program – Determines how many sweets each pupil receives and any remainder.
*These programs reinforce basic Python skills such as input/output, calculations, string formatting, and conditional logic.

Programming Portfolio – Week 3
This week’s programs practice user input, validation, and loops. I made a greeting program that handles empty names, a password system with checks for length, matches, and common passwords, and multiplication table programs that can print any table forward or backward. These exercises help create interactive, user-friendly Python programs.

Programming Portfolio – Week 4
This week’s portfolio focuses on using Python functions to handle user input, strings, and numbers. Programs include: validating numbers in a range, counting uppercase and lowercase letters, formatting names consistently, removing the last character from strings, converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and processing multiple temperature inputs to find the maximum, minimum, and average. These exercises practice functions, input handling, string manipulation, and basic calculations in a practical, reusable way.

Programming Portfolio – Week 5
This week’s programs focus on using command-line arguments in Python. They include checking the operating system, counting arguments, finding the shortest argument, verifying if a website is reachable, calculating minimum, maximum, and average temperatures from command-line inputs, and creating backup copies of files. Each program handles missing or invalid inputs gracefully and demonstrates practical use of Python’s standard library and command-line interaction.

6 Programming Portfolio – Review
This week’s exercises cover numbers, factors, primes, and string encryption.
Key Takeaways:
*Learned to convert integers to binary in Python.
*Practiced finding factors and checking for prime numbers.
*Explored basic string encryption by reversing text and embedding messages in random letters.
*Developed a corresponding decryption function to recover hidden messages.
*Emphasized writing clear, simple, and readable solutions.
These programs strengthen understanding of functions, loops, and string/list manipulation, while also introducing basic concepts of encryption.

Programming Portfolio Week 7
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating string and dictionary operations:
*Unique Letter Sorter: Returns a sorted list of unique letters from a string.
*Letter Set Operations: Performs union, intersection, and symmetric difference on two words.
*Country & Capital Manager: Stores countries and their capitals, allowing case-insensitive queries and additions.
*Letter Frequency Analysis: Counts letters in a message and displays the six most common ones, ignoring case.
Each program showcases Python fundamentals, including functions, sets, dictionaries, and user input handling.

Week 8 Programming Portfolio
*This week, we built Python versions of classic Unix commands to practice file handling, string operations, and command-line tools. The programs include:
*Line Number Printer (nl) – Adds line numbers to a text file for easier reading.
*File Comparator (diff) – Checks if two files are identical or different.
*Pattern Searcher (grep) – Finds and prints lines containing a specific word or phrase.
*Word & Line Counter (wc) – Counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
*Spell Checker (spell) – Detects words not found in a dictionary for simple spell-checking.
These programs demonstrate practical Python skills for everyday text processing tasks.
